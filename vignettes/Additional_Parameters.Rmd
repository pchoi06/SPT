```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
# load all the in-development package code
devtools::load_all("..") # once the package is published replace this with library(SPT)
require(tibble)
```

Again, the changes made to the `parameterCalculation()` function in Sicegar has not changed its base functionality so we again reference you to their Additional_Parameters vignette which will detail the process of extracting additional information of interest about the fitted curves, such as the midpoint of the curve and the slope at the midpoint:

```{r}
vignette("additional_parameters", package = "sicegar")
```
